## Data & Privacy

This project uses **fully synthetic data only**.
No proprietary, customer, OEM, or internal company data is included.

Sensitive identifiers (e.g., claim numbers, VINs, dealer/customer identifiers)
are explicitly handled in a dedicated sanitization step to demonstrate
privacy-by-design in analytics pipelines.
